# Project Structure Guide

This file describes the high-level layout of the repository:

- `client/`: Front-end application built with React and Vite. Key entry: [vite.config.ts](mdc:vite.config.ts).
- `server/`: Back-end services, API endpoints, and business logic configured via [drizzle.config.ts](mdc:drizzle.config.ts).
- `shared/`: Shared utility functions, types, and modules used by both client and server.
- `scripts/`: Automation and tool scripts (e.g., database seeders, CLI utilities).
- `migrations/`: Database migration files managed by the ORM.
- `public/`: Static assets served by the application at runtime.
- `attached_assets/`: Additional non-code assets such as uploads and media.
- `dist/`: Build output directory (generated by production builds, ignored by version control).
- `.config/`: Project configuration files like [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:.config/tailwind.config.ts) and [postcss.config.js](mdc:postcss.config.js).
- `.cursor/rules/`: Custom Cursor AI assistance rules, including [general.mdc](mdc:general.mdc) and newly added guides.
