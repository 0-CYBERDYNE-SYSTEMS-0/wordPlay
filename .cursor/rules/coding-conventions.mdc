# Coding Conventions

This file outlines the code style, naming conventions, and best practices across the project:

- Use TypeScript consistently across both client and server for type safety.
- File and folder names should follow kebab-case (e.g., `user-profile.tsx`).
- React component files should be PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`).
- Hooks should follow an `use` prefix in camelCase (e.g., `useFetchData`).
- Default exports only when a module has a single primary export; otherwise, use named exports.
- Keep modules focused on a single responsibility and avoid tight coupling.
- Expose AI-driven features via front-end slash commands; avoid mixing AI logic into core business modules.
- Avoid placeholder or simulated code; ensure all implementations are real and testable.
- Reuse shared utilities from `shared/` to prevent duplication.
- Follow the DRY principle and maintain clear separation of concerns.
- Commit messages should be concise, reference issue IDs when applicable, and use imperative mood.
